title: 我，平面设计界的 “搬砖侠”：用创意砌高楼
description: 在平面设计的广袤天地里，一块一块地用创意砌起巍峨的视觉高楼。回首往昔，从大学时期的设计启蒙，到工作中的磨砺与成长，我的设计思维也如同一棵幼苗，逐渐长成参天大树，从最初的懵懂简单，慢慢向程序员般严谨、逻辑化的思维方式转变。

Hi! My name is José Pablo, I am 21 years old and a software development student from Costa Rica. I have been studying software development for the past three years, focusing on building efficient and innovative digital solutions. My journey has equipped me with the skills needed to create dynamic and user-friendly websites, and I stay updated with the latest technological trends in this ever-evolving field. Creating engaging online experiences is at the core of what I do.

My passion for technology began early and has grown as I pursued formal studies in software development. Over the years, I have built a solid foundation in key languages and frameworks. Recently, I have been expanding my skills in modern web technologies and exploring advanced design concepts.

Currently, I am focusing on refining my skills in languages like C# and TypeScript, and I am working on my personal website using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I am inspired by industry leaders and always look for ways to improve my work. To see more of my projects, you can explore my GitHub repository <a href='https://github.com/JosePabloSG' target='_blank'>Here</a>.
